# DwarfVille - DwarfVille is an academic project without a business value to the end user. 
# Its main purpose is to learn about good practices, design patterns, architecture patterns. 
# Every group working on DwarfVille starts from the 'develop' branch and spawns their own branch.
# This project is incomplete by nature as the process of development is more important than the final result.
